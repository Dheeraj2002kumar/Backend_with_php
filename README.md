<h4>Php Variables</h4>
<p>In this tutorial, we will learn thoroughly about the PHP variables, their use, and how they can help us make our PHP websites better. We learned what PHP is; we discussed and familiarized ourselves with Visual Studio Code, XAMPP. We also learned about using frameworks such as Bootstrap 5. Moreover, we also learned about the syntax of PHP and its components. Before getting started with today's lecture, I would recommend watching the necessary lectures to understand the concept of PHP variables better.</p>
<h4>What are Variables?</h4>
<p>
A variable in the field of programming can be best defined as follows,<br>

“A variable is a container that holds information or data which can change with time depending upon the conditions, information, or data passed to the program aptly. Characteristically, a program comprises commands or instructions for the computer, which instructs the machine to process information that the program utilizes when running.”<br>

Let us understand the concept of variables step-by-step. We assign variables for a specific value that can be changed with time when required. For example, if you want to write a program to add 2 numbers, you can create 2 variables and change them. doing this will make your program work for any number in general. Here variables can be created to hold these numbers. In order to use PHP variables, we should first learn how they work and what their use is in complex programs. A variable is fundamentally a compartment that holds data or information that can change with time, based on the circumstances. Various conditions depend upon the user’s need for data or information that the program requires at a given time. Variables help the programmer change the value of a container at any time, giving him the flexibility to generalize the program. Typically, a program contains directions or guidelines for the PC that instructs the PC to perform various operations on data whenever a program is running on the computer. To make this data changeable, we need variables.

<h4>Why do we use Variables?</h4>
<p>Let’s talk about the use of variables. When we are learning a concept, we should know why are we learning it? What is the goal? And how will it make our lives easy? Suppose you are working on a huge site, and with time you always have to update information on your website (say color, title, logo, etc.). In that case, you cannot just go through the whole website, change everything one by one, etc. That would be very tedious. Variables will protect you from such hardships, and in case of updating your sites in the future, you will have to change the value of the variable, not the whole script of your website.</p>
<h4>How to create a variable</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Put a “$” sign before the variable and declare it</li>
  <li>Assign the value to the variable during declaration or later sometime in the script.</li>
</ol>
