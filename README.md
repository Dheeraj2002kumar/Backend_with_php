We learned what PHP is; we discussed and familiarized ourselves with Visual Studio Code, XAMPP. We also learned about using frameworks such as Bootstrap 5. Moreover, we also learned about the syntax of PHP and its components. Before getting started with today's lecture, I would recommend watching the necessary lectures to understand the concept of PHP variables better.</p>
